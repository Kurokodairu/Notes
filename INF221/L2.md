## Proof by induction
We have a proposition for n=1, n=2, n=3.. wich we call P(1), P(2), P(3).
We then prove the proposition first for the base case, usually P(1).
We assume P2, P3, P(n) all hold and prove that P(n+1) also holds under this assumption, thus we have proven the proposition for all n.

First line is n, because we first initialize and at the end j will be A.length +1 (checks for end)
$t_j$ will be from the start j = 2, until the list is sorted, then it will no longer go into the "t" loop.
