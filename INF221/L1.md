Algorithm
A well-defined computational procedure
Takes input
Transforms it to output
It thus solves a computational problem

Proof of correctnes for sorting alogithm
Prove:
- The algorithm terminates
- The output contains exactly the same keys as input
- The output contains the keys in sorted order

### Loop invariants
- Key technique for proving statements about algorithms
- Precise statement about the status of data at a certain time during execution
- Prove algorithm correctness using *induction* in three steps:
    - **Initialization:** The invariant is true before the first iteration of the loop
    - **Maintenance:** If the invariant is true before any given iteration of the loop, it is true also before the next iteration
    - **Termination:** When the loop terminates, the invariant provides information about the state of the data which helps us to show that the algorithm is correct (did the right thing)
