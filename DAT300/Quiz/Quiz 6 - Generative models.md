## Spørsmål 1

**What key assumption does Naive Bayes make about the features of the data?**  
✅ Riktig svar: Features are independent of each other

>[!example]- Wrong answers
>- Features are dependent on each other
>- Features are randomly distributed
>- None of the provided answers

---

## Spørsmål 2

**Why does Naive Bayes often fail when applied to image data?**  
✅ Riktig svar: It assumes pixel independence, which is false in images

>[!example]- Wrong answer
>- It assumes linear relationships between features
>- Naive Bayes never fails
>- None of the provided answers

---

## Spørsmål 3

**What is one major challenge Naive Bayes faces in high-dimensional data like images?**  
✅ Riktig svar: It fails to model the complex relationships between features

>[!example]- Wrong answers
>- It overfits the data easily
>- It performs too many random calculations
>- None of the provided answers

## Spørsmål 4

**Which of the following is a primary objective of generative models?**  
✅ Riktig svar: To generate new data samples similar to the training data

>[!example]- Wrong answers
>- To memorize the training data perfectly
>- To classify data based on existing labels
>- None of the provided answers

---

## Spørsmål 5

**In generative models, what is the role of random noise?**  
✅ Riktig svar: To introduce variations and allow the model to create new data

>[!example]- Wrong answers
>- To ensure the model generates only known data
>- To reduce the training time of the model
>- None of the provided answers

---

## Spørsmål 6

**Why is the independence assumption of Naive Bayes problematic for images?**  
✅ Riktig svar: Neighboring pixels in an image are often highly dependent on each other

>[!example]- Wrong answers
>- It only works for black-and-white images
>- It assumes each pixel represents a different object
>- None of the provided answer

---

## Spørsmål 7

**Which type of data is Naive Bayes most effective with?**  
✅ Riktig svar: Structured data with independent features

>[!example]- Wrong answers
>- High-dimensional image data
>- Time-series data
>- None of the provided answer

---

## Spørsmål 8

**What is the purpose of using generative models for data?**  
✅ Riktig svar: To generate new, unseen data samples that follow the patterns of the training data

>[!example]- Wrong answers
>- To classify data based on predefined labels
>- To cluster data
>- None of the provided answers
